# AI Subsystem Details

This directory groups all components related to model training, inference and
deployment. Each subpackage delivers a specific capability that can be combined
to run the Ultimate Agent on a single machine or a distributed cluster.

## Package guide

### `backends/`
Advanced integration with remote inference providers. The included
`ollama_advanced` client offers:
- connection pooling for many model instances
- automatic load balancing and failover
- health checks with auto-recovery of crashed nodes
- support for streaming responses and batch jobs
- hooks for performance tuning and custom logging

### `chat/`
Home of the `ConversationManager` used by the dashboard chat interface. Key
features include:
- session tracking and context memory for multi-turn chats
- configurable personality templates and response creativity
- per-user rate limiting and usage statistics
- utilities for message queues and conversation history

### `distributed/`
Tools for spreading large models across machines. Provides:
- a distributed attention protocol for multi-head transformers
- `DistributedAIManager` for orchestrating model shards
- asynchronous communication helpers

### `inference/`
Contains a lightweight `InferenceEngine` returning mock predictions. Useful for
tests or as a simple fallback when heavy models are unavailable.

### `local_models/`
Local execution engine that detects available hardware and loads quantized
models accordingly. Highlights:
- optional Ollama integration for faster GPU inference
- automatic selection of optimal model variants
- statistics on request counts and average response time

### `models/`
Core abstractions for registering models and managing their lifecycle. The
`AIModelManager` coordinates training sessions, caching and inference pipelines.

### `swarm/`
Minimal swarm coordination layer. The `SwarmCoordinator` lets multiple nodes
share work and combine results, enabling decentralized experiments.

### `training/`
Implementation of the `AITrainingEngine` and related utilities. Supports
standard supervised learning as well as federated and privacy-preserving modes
(via `federated_privacy.py`).

## Typical usage

Most applications create an `AIModelManager` and attach the training and
inference engines. Higher-level components such as the chat interface rely on
these managers to run models:

```python
from ultimate_agent.ai.models import AIModelManager
from ultimate_agent.ai.training import AITrainingEngine
from ultimate_agent.ai.chat import ConversationManager

config = {...}
model_manager = AIModelManager(config)
training = AITrainingEngine(model_manager)
chat = ConversationManager(model_manager, config)
```
